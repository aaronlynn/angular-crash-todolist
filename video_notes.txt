Angular is a full featured JS framework created & maintained
by Google and is used for building front-end applications or
the front-end part of a full stack applications

Angular is very popular in large enterprise

One of the big three (React, Vue, Angular)

AngularJS was released in 2010. Not recommended and should be
updated to Angular

Angular refers to version 2+. Right now we are on version 7
but 2-7 is the same framework with a few changes, mostly under
the hood

Why use Angular?
- Organized front-end structure (Components, Modules, Services)
- Extremely powerful & full featured
- All-in-one solution (Routing, HTTP, RxJS, etc)
- Build powerful SPA applications
- MVC - Model, View, Controller design pattern
- TypeScript
- Fantastic CLI

What you should know before learning Angular:
- JavaScript Fundamentals

May help to learn these first:
- TypeScript
- Classes
- High Order Array Methods - forEach, map, filter
- Arrow Functions
- Promises & Observables
- MVC Pattern

The Angular Way
- Uses TypeScript for static types (variables, funcs, params)
- Component based (Like other frameworks)
- Uses "services" to share data/functionality between components
- Concept of "modules" (root, forms, http, etc)
- Uses RxJS "observables" for async operations
- Steep learning curve relative to other frameworks

A note on State Management:
You can use state managers like ngrx and Redux with Angular
for larger apps

Brad finds it less necessary due to the overall structure of
the framework and services which are used to share data and
functionality.
